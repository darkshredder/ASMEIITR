                                        We participated in the 7th Inter IIT Technical Meet held in IIT Bombay and won GOLD in the TCTD (TATA Centre for Technolo- gy and Design) challenge and General Championship among 22 other IITs. The competition’s central theme was “Farm tools that reduce drudgery and provide intelligent automation”, We designed and prototyped a “Black pepper Harvester”, a Robot which autonomously navigates, harvests, and collects the pep- percorn for further processing. Using efficient mechanical sys- tems and smart image processing techniques our robot com- pletes this cumbersome process economically, paving way for better production on a global scale, as no such technology exist- ed earlier.

This competition is organized every year as a part of E-fest by ASME Asia-Pacific. ASME IIT Roorkee Chapter has engineered three vehi- cles on account of our three-year participation, Team Faith (2017), Team Nimbus 2k18(2018) and Team <br/> <br/>

Every year this theme-based competition comes up with innovative prob- lem statements that involve 4-5 teams competing simul- taneously. ASME IIT Roorkee Chapter participated for the first time this year and engineered robots that play foot-ball.

                                        Every year IRC presents itself with challenging problem statements thus making the team explore new areas of robotics. It involves fabrication of 2 types of bots: manual and autonomous which would operate in coordination with each other to complete various challenging tasks. ASME IIT Roorkee Chapter won the 2nd place in the
national level and 3rd place in the international level at IRC 2017

                                        Poseidon is a robotic race type shipping event where the participants have to complete laps on the track in the minimum possible time opting tricky shortcuts crossing many obstructions which resembles inferno in reality. ASME IIT Roorkee Chapter participates in this competi- tion every year and were able able to secure 2nd posi- tion in 2017 edition of the event.
