This conference experienced the presence of Mr Mike J. Rovins, Director, Sales and Services & Madhu- kar Sharma, ASME Staff member, ASME INDIA. The conference was embellished by Dr. S.N. Sinha Dean of Student Welfare IIT Roorkee, as the chief guest. SPDC is 2-tier event held first at the national level, which was held at IIT Roorkee and then at internationals level (con- sisting of Singapore, India, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Pa- kistan) at BITS Dubai.

There were three events conducted in the past 5 years having a gap of 3 weeks between them.

                                        Industrial visit help students gain first hand information regarding functioning of industry. So, we organized an industrial visit to ITC Limited and Hero Motocorp, Harid- war plant for first year students.
Over 100 students registered for industrial visit but due to limited seats only 50 students visited the industries. It was a good learning experience for 1st year students.

                                        ASME IIT Roorkee became the only student section in India to be awarded the prestigious Diversity Action Grant (DAG) . Team made full use of the grant which is aimed at promoting science and technology among school going community and the girls.
We organized the science fair for school and invited vari- ous schools of Roorkee to participate in it. The schools responded in really enthusiastic manner and about 350 students participated.

                                        This program was started with the objective of sharing knowledge and experience in the field of robotics amongst the first year students.Over 200 students regis- tered for the mentorship program. Students were divided into groups of five and mentors from the executive team were assigned to guide them. Every lecture and work- shop was followed by an interactive session with the mentor of each group and members of the team were taught about the various concepts covered in detail and further study material was provided to them by the mentor.

                                        A number of introductory robotics lectures are conducted for the students which cover topics like Mechanical Aspects, Drives, Motors, Gears, Sensors, Intro to Arduino Programming etc. The students are regularly examined and tested on the basis of the topics covered in the lectures.
The lectures are aimed at giving them a fair idea about the vast world of Robotics and the amazing events and activities they can participate in being a part of ASME.
Through attending the lectures the students acquaint them- selves with the necessary theoretical knowledge to get a head start in the field of Robotics.
